      Yuxi Global (called Yuxi Pacific at the time) was founded in 2005 in Pennsylvania, USA, by the entre- preneur Michael
      Puscar. In 2011 we opened a small office in Medellín, Colombia for research & deve- lopment and were surprised by
      the quality of the local talent. Our sales and employee numbers began doubling each year and since all our operations
      were moved to Medellín.

      In 2013 the company was acquired by Blue Loop Capital, an investment firm from USA owned by a single stakeholder, the
      serial entrepreneur, inventor, and investor Kent Savage. In 2016 we rebranded ourselves as Yuxi Global, adopting
      a more modern image which reflects the maturity we’ve reached and our capability of tackling challenges from all
      over the world.
