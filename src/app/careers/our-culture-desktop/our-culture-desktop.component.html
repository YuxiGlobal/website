      Having a good work environment is having happy employees. This accounts for both location and ambience: Yuxians have access
      to free fruit, cereals, coffee, and snacks. We host activities like guided active pauses and monthly massages. Our
      offices are spaces designed to be both comfortable and inspiring, letting creativity flow freely.

      You don’t only work to live: life also happens inside the office. For many years society has thought that work is a hindrance
      that stops us from living our actual life, something so drudging that you actually get paid for it. It’s time to change
      that: #YuxiLife is our way of creating conditions where people can feel happy, encouraged, and motivated about going
      to work. #YuxiLife is, more than a lifestyle, our workstyle.</p>
